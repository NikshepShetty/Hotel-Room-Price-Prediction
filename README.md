# Hotel Room Price Prediction

## Overview
This project analyzes hotel reservation data to predict room prices using machine learning and deep learning techniques. Using a Kaggle dataset with 36,275 entries and 19 features, the project aims to understand and predict factors influencing hotel room pricing.

Data Source: [Kaggle Hotel Reservations Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsan81/hotel-reservations-classification-dataset)

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values
   - Removed duplicates
   - Standardized formats

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed patterns in booking data
   - Identified key price influencing factors
   - Visualized relationships between variables
   - Principal Component Analysis(PDA)

3. **Model Development**
   - Implemented machine learning and deep learning models
   - Evaluated model performance
   - Fine-tuned for optimal predictions

## Dependencies
- R (for Data Cleaning and EDA)
- Python
- Keras

## Grade Achieved
